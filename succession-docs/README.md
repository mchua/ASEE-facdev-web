This is the beginning of the succession documentation for the ASEE Faculty Development Constituent Committee Web Chair.

== Past postition holders ==

* Mel Chua (mchua) - 2018 to present, first web chair

== Open questions ==

Right now, we're new. All the questions are open.

* What are the requirements ASEE has of us for web presence?
* What are the resources ASEE provides for us for web presence, and which ones are mandatory vs. options we can choose?
* What do we want for web presence

== Existing infrastructure ==

* Website (here on github)
* Task tracker (also here on github)
* Hangouts chat for History, Web, and Communications chairs (by invitation when you have a leadership position)
* Mailing list https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/engr-pod -- so named because we started as a group of ASEE folks who also went to the POD Network Conference (for faculty development more generally).
* Shared Google Drive folder, https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XpwfagE7dpXGOLKyWIBRqpbAsyhdG8IK (should be world-readable; ask for edit access)
