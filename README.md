Existing infrastructure 
==========================

* Website (here on github)
* Task tracker (also here on github)
* Hangouts chat for History, Web, and Communications chairs (by invitation when you have a leadership position)
* Mailing list https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/engr-pod -- so named because we started as a group of ASEE folks who also went to the POD Network Conference (for faculty development more generally).
* Shared Google Drive folder, https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XpwfagE7dpXGOLKyWIBRqpbAsyhdG8IK (should be world-readable; ask for edit access)
