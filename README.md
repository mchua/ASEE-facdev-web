What we do
=============

The goal of the Faculty Development Constituent Committee is to create a more visible role for engineering education faculty developers. We often work in the translation of research to practice, and act as a contact point for sharing expertise around faculty development.

As a recently (2018) organized cohort within the ASEE ([American Society for Engineering Education](http://asee.org)) community, our intention is to strategically facilitate sessions and meet ups where faculty development practitioners and researchers can connect and collaborate with other faculty developers. Together, we dialogue around current research, share resources and promising practices, and discuss issues relevant to the faculty that we serve.

Resources 
==========================

Stay tuned for our resource library - we're just getting started, so these resources will expand as we grow.

How to join
=============

First, [join the discussion on our mailing list!](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/engr-pod) This list is our primary gathering place at present. It is open to anyone who's interested in joining the conversation, whether or not they are a formal member of ASEE or our Constitutent Committee within ASEE. Announcements, questions, and general community chat all take place here. We look forward to meeting you online!
